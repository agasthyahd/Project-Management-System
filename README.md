# Project-Record-System-MVC-project
Registration can be done in the  website where the data is stored in the mysql database.User can login to register his projects, check the projects that he has entered.
The complete project has been done using MVC concepts in php. Also, I have used bootstrap css, javascript libraries throughout the project to enhance the overall look and feel of the project.The bootstrap adds the responsiveness  to the web pages.
